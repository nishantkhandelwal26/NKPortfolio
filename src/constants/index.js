export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm Nishant, a passionate 3rd-year B.Tech student at Malaviya National Institute of Technology (MNIT). I have a strong interest in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Operating Systems (OS). My journey in technology has been fueled by a deep curiosity and a drive to solve complex problems through efficient coding practices.

I have a solid command of Java, which I frequently use to tackle challenging DSA problems. I'm also honing my skills in dynamic programming, particularly in scenarios where optimization is key, such as maximizing promotion bonuses or selecting optimal values from matrices.

Currently, I'm preparing for an SDE internship and aiming to contribute to innovative projects that require robust problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of computer science fundamentals. My focus is on continually improving my technical abilities and applying them in real-world scenarios.

I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and organizations.`;
